   2. Uniformity of caliber.
   3. Character of ammunition.
   4. Interchangeability of parts.
   5. Condition of present supply on hand in the various arsenals.

# Rules Adopted By the Board

1. Tests will be done using ammunition furnished by the inventors.
2. Test will be performed by subjecting each arm to the same tests as far as practicable.
3. Investigations are limited to the determination of the relative merits of the various systems of breech-loading small arms, without regard to questions of caliber, rifling, ammunition, &c.
4. The main elements of excellence considered are:
   1. Strength.
   2. Durability.
   3. Simplicity of the Breech Mechanims.
   4. Ease, Certainty, and Rapidity of Firing.
   5. Security Against Injury to Arms.
   6. Security Against Accidents from Use in the Hands of Troops.

# Program of Experiments
1. *Simplicity of Construction* - Each arm to be dismounted [disassembled], examined, and the number of its pieces to be noted.
2. *Accuracy of Fire* - Fifteen shots to be fired from a fixed rest at a target; distance, 100 yards.
3. *Rapidity of Fire* - Twenty-five shots to be fired from the shoulder; fair aim to be taken at the target; distance, 100 yards.
4. *Endurance* - Each gun to be fired at a target 500 times from a fixed rest; distance, 100 yeards. The arm to be allowed to cool at the end of each 100 rounds, but not to be cleaned during the test. At the end of this test, the arm to be cleaned and examined, to ascertain its conditions.
5. *Effects of Exposure to the Weather and Firing* - Four hundred rounds to be fired without cleaning the arm; one hundred on each alternate day. The arm to be exposed to the effects of the sun and rain (or water artificially applied) during each day of the tests, and the exposure continued for three days thereafter. The arm then to be cleaned and examined.
6. *Effects of Sand and Dust on the Breach Mechanism* -
   1. Eight shots to be fired;
   2. Fine dry sand to be sifted over the breech mechanism when closed, and eight shots fired.
   3. Fine dry sand to be sifted over the same parts when open, and nine shots fired.
   4. The sand to be removed in each case by shaking the piece, or using only the hand.
   5. The piece then to be examined and cleaned.
7. *Effects of Salt Water* - The arm to be placed for three hours in brine, covering the breech mechanism and chamber; then to be exposed in the open air until the next day, and fifty shots to be fired.
8. *Effects of Defective Ammunition* - The arm to be fired with six cartridges rendered defective in the following manner:
   1. One cut longitudinally from the end of the case to the rim, and placed in the chamber with the cut upwards.
   2. One cut longitudinally from the end of the case to the rim, and placed in the chamber with the cut downwards.
   3. One to be cut helically from the end of the rim.
   4. One to be cut at the base, so that the firing pin in firing will pierce it.
   5. One to be pierced through the base at four points.
   6. One to be filed through the rim.
9. *Strength of the Breech Mechanism* -
   1. The arm to be fired once with a double charge of powder and lead.
   2. The arm to be fired once with a triple charge of powder and lead.
